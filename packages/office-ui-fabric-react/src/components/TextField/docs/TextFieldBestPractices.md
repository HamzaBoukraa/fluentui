### Layout

- Use a multiline text field when long entries are expected.
- Don't place a text field in the middle of a sentence, because the sentence structure might not make sense in all languages. For example, "Remind me in [textfield] weeks" should instead read, "Remind me in this many weeks [textfield]".
- Whenever possible, format the text field for the expected entry. For example, four fields for a four-digit PIN, three fields for a phone number.

### Content

- Include a short label above the text field to communicate what information should be entered.
- Use sentence-style capitalization—only capitalize the first word. For more info, see [Capitalization](https://docs.microsoft.com/style-guide/capitalization) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.  
- Don't use placeholder text instead of a label. Placeholder text poses a variety of accessibility issues (including possible problems with color/contrast, and people thinking the form input is already filled out).
- When part of a form, make it clear which fields are required vs. optional. If the input is required, add "(required)" to the label. Don't exclusively use "\*" to indicate required inputs as it is often not read by screen readers. For example, "First name (required)".
