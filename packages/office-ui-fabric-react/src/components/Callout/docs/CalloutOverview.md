A callout is an anchored tip that can be used to teach people or guide them through the app without blocking them.

A real-world example can be seen in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center where a particularly complex concept is paired with the iconClassNames.info "i" icon. When you hover over or select the icon, the callout appears.
