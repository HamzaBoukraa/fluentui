## Layout

- When possible, try a non-blocking dialog box before resorting to a blocking dialog. 
- Don't provide people with more than 3 buttons.
- Validate that people’s entries are acceptable before closing the dialog box. Show an inline validation error near the field they must correct. 
- Dialog boxes consist of a header, body, and footer. 

<b>Header</b>

- Locks to the top of the dialog. 
- Includes a Close button in the top-right corner. 
- May include an icon to the left of the title. 


<b>Footer</b> 

- Includes one primary button. A secondary button is optional.  
- Lock buttons to the bottom of the dialog.


<b>Width</b>

- Maximum is 340 pixels. 
- Minimum is 288 pixels. 


<b>Height</b>

- Maximum is 340 pixels. 
- Minimum is 172 pixels. 


## Content

<b>Title</b>

- This mandatory content should explain the main information in a clear, concise, and specific statement or question. For example, “Delete this file?” instead of “Are you sure?” 
- The title shouldn’t be a description of the body content. For example, don’t use “Error” as a title. Instead, use an informative statement like “Your session ended.” 
- Keep the title as concise as possible. 
- Don’t use periods at the end of titles. 
- Use sentence-style capitalization—only capitalize the first word. For more info, see [Capitalization] in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.

<b>Body copy (Optional)</b>

- Use the optional body content area for additional info or instructions, if needed. Only include information needed to help people make a decision.
- Don't restate the title in the body. 
- Use actionable language, with the most important information at the beginning. 
- Use ending punctuation on sentences.


<b>Button labels</b>

- Write button labels that are specific responses to the main information in the title. The title “Delete this file?” could have buttons labeled “Delete” and “Cancel.” 
- Be concise. Limit labels to one or two words. Usually a single verb is best. Include a noun if there is any room for interpretation about what the verb means. For example, “Delete” or “Delete file.”
